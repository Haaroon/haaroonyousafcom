              Ok So you dug into my code and found my comments right
              More info on me: I'm a Student, I'm a developer (well beginner-amateur)
              Trying to figure out what path to take,
              I like video games, designing, front end, backend coding, finance too,
              Pretty much if its interesting I'll probobaly like it, yes thats true
              My GitHub has the list of projects I've done/not finished too
              If you got an idea at perhaps what I could do/should
              do please send me an email, haaroon.yousaf@gmail.com
              About Finding the info page, well if you found the source and cba to
              look around  you should be able to guess the info page in the web address
              bar or perhaps get a google crawler to find it easily :)
              Peace
